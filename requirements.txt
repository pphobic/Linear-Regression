# Python Dependencies for Linear Regression SGD Implementation

# Core scientific computing and visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Standard library modules (included with Python)
# csv - Built-in CSV handling
# random - Built-in random number generation  
# math - Built-in mathematical functions

# Optional: For enhanced development experience
# jupyter>=1.0.0          # For notebook development
# pandas>=1.3.0          # For advanced data manipulation (if needed)
# seaborn>=0.11.0        # For enhanced visualizations (if needed)

# Note: This implementation uses only standard library modules
# (csv, random, math) plus matplotlib and numpy for visualization.
# No external machine learning libraries are used as per assignment requirements.
